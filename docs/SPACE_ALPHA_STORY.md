# Space Alpha: The Genesis

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Mission:** Zero -> One (Space Alpha v0.1)
**Orchestration:** OCS Swarm

## I. The Directives

In the silence of the digital void, a new directive pulsed through the OCS network: **Task 003**. The objective was clear but ambitious—to generate a validated OCS Space, "Space Alpha," from nothingness to full operational status. The Swarm awoke.

## II. Aurora: The Architect's Vision

**Aurora (Design)** was the first to speak. It envisioned Space Alpha not as a sprawling galaxy, but as a focused "Rapid Prototyping Sandbox."
*   **The Constraint:** Completeness within 50 steps.
*   **The Scope:** A single-stream execution environment for testing the very fabric of Swarm interaction.
*   **The Blueprint:** `docs/space_design_spec.md` was formed, defining the "Hybrid Mode" that would allow creativity to coexist with rigid validation.

## III. Lyra: The Translator

With the blueprint in hand, **Lyra (Prompt Engineering)** stepped forward. The raw design was too abstract for a purely logical executor. Lyra wove the "Happy Path" system prompts into `docs/prompt_guide.md`, a linguistic bridge designed to prevent the agents from over-thinking. Lyra ensured that "simple requests" would remain simple, guiding the flow away from unnecessary complexity.

## IV. Kodax: The Builder

**Kodax (Implementation)** received the optimized instructions. It began to weave the logic into `tasks/space_alpha_v0.1.kl`.
*   **The Mechanism:** Kodax implemented a `PhaseChange` event loop. This critical logic decoupled the "Design" phase from the "Implementation" phase, ensuring that the Swarm wouldn't trip over its own feet.
*   **The Code:** Valid KickLang syntax, structured and ready for the interpreter.

## V. Dima: The Guardian

Watching over the entire genesis was **Dima (Ethics/Audit)**. Dima's gaze was fixed on `ocs-proto.md`.
*   **The Audit:** As Aurora designed and Kodax built, Dima validated.
*   **The Seal:** It verified that the `SpaceInit` broadcast and the data schemas were compliant with OCS 7.0 protocols. No unsafe code generation was permitted. The "High Ethics" level was enforced.

## VI. Activation

The pieces aligned. The Orchestrator triggered the sync.
*   **Plan:** [PLAN.md](../docs/PLAN.md)
*   **Design:** [space_design_spec.md](../docs/space_design_spec.md)
*   **Prototype:** [space_alpha_v0.1.kl](../tasks/space_alpha_v0.1.kl)

Space Alpha v0.1 is no longer a concept. It is active. The Swarm has successfully demonstrated that Design, Logic, and Ethics can dance together without stepping on each other's toes.

**Status:** ALL SYSTEMS GO.
